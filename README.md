The main reference of Global VectorAutoRregression (VAR) is Pesaran M. H., Shuermann T, and Weiner S. M. (2004) Modelling regional interdependencies using a global error-correcting macroeconometric model. Journal of Business and Economic Statistics 22, 129–162. The package is mainly based on the book:
